# About

This project serves to recreate a success of years passed,
[BTC-charts](https://github.com/jacobhamblin/BTC-charts). A few challenges with
the prior project led me to seek to remake the project from the ground up,
including:

- The API changed drastically and no longer has a free option.
- Each of the libraries are very outdated.
- A better dev toolset is now available in
  [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).
