# About

This project serves to recreate a success of years passed, [BTC-charts](https://github.com/jacobhamblin/BTC-charts). A few challenges with the prior project lead me to seek to remake the project from the ground up, including:

- The API changed drastically and no longer has a free option.
- Each of the libraries are very outdated.
- A better dev toolset is now available in [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).
